## Zebrafish brain
* Find above OCT image stacks (AVI format) corresponding to CTRL, ZnO and Fe3O4 - zebrafish brain samples.
* Acquisitions that showed strong horizontal line artefacts were bandpass filtered to improve image quality. Line artefacts can arise due to multiple reflections from cover slip, petri dish, etc. 
* x_Microscope.png shows a microscope image of each sample to ensure correct orientation. 
* A 10x scanning lens was used for imaging.

### Results
* No obvious difference in signal intensity was noticed between ctrl and suspended nanoparticle images.
* Depolarization does not show differences between ctrl and suspended nanoparticle samples. Depolarization is expected to show contrast for nanorods (not spheres) with a resonance wavelength equal or close to the center wavelength of the OCT light source.

## Suspensions
* Suspensions were sonicated for at least 10 min before imaging.
* Find above photo montages (montage_22,162,182,197.png & montage_206(1),206(2),Al,Fe.png) of single frames for each suspension at time 0min, 2min, 5min after sonification.
* Also find above real time acquisitions (25 frames per second) of the different suspensions. The movie frame rate was slowed down by a factor of two. 
* Movies were recorded for 4 seconds (100 frames) at approximately 0 minutes, 2 minutes and 5 minutes after sonication. 
* A 5x scanning lens was used for imaging.
* Suspensions were mounted at ~ 20 deg to avoid specular reflections from the glass tubes. 
* Suspension 206(3) opened during sonication and was accidentally destroyed.

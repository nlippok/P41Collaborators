* Find above OCT image stacks corresponding to CTRL, ZnO and Fe3O4 - zebrafish brain samples.
* Acquisitions that showed strong horizontal line artefacts were bandpass filtered to improve image quality. Line artefacts can arise due to multiple reflections from cover slip, petri dish, etc. 
* x_Microscope.png shows a microscope image of each sample to ensure correct orientation. 


### Results
* No clear differences were noticeable between ctrl and suspended nanoparticle images.
* Depolarization does not show differences between ctrl and suspended nanoparticle samples. Depolarization is expected to show contrast for nanorods (not spheres) with a resonance wavelength equal or close to the center wavelength of the OCT light source.
